# Add Cards component with full feature parity to Tables

## Summary

Implements a new Cards component that provides the same powerful filtering, sorting, and pagination features as the Table component, but renders data as flexible cards instead of rows. This addresses user demand for more flexible data presentation options while maintaining the robust functionality that makes Cinder tables so powerful.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Card-based data display** with custom `:card` slots for flexible rendering
- ✅ **Full sorting functionality** with clickable sort controls above the card grid
- ✅ **Complete filtering support** - all filter types (text, select, range, multi-select, etc.)
- ✅ **Pagination** with state preservation and navigation controls
- ✅ **URL state synchronization** for browser back/forward support
- ✅ **Async data loading** with proper error handling and loading states

### Advanced Features
- ✅ **Interactive cards** with `card_click` functionality (equivalent to `row_click`)
- ✅ **Query compatibility** - works with both `resource` and `query` parameters
- ✅ **Relationship support** using dot notation (e.g., `user.department.name`)
- ✅ **Embedded field support** using double underscore notation (e.g., `profile__country`)
- ✅ **Multi-tenant support** with actor/tenant/scope handling
- ✅ **Custom read actions** and pre-filtered queries

### Theming & Design
- ✅ **Complete theme integration** across all 8 built-in themes
- ✅ **Responsive grid layouts** with customizable breakpoints
- ✅ **Sort control theming** with visual indicators and hover states
- ✅ **Loading and empty state styling** consistent with table themes
- ✅ **Card-specific theme properties** for maximum customization

## 🎯 API Consistency

The Cards component maintains perfect consistency with the Table component API:

| Table Component | Cards Component | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `:col` slots | `:prop` slots | Define filterable/sortable properties |
| `row_click` | `card_click` | Interactive click handling |
| `resource`/`query` | `resource`/`query` | Data source configuration |
| `actor`/`tenant`/`scope` | `actor`/`tenant`/`scope` | Authorization handling |
| `url_state` | `url_state` | URL synchronization |
| `theme` | `theme` | Styling configuration |

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Basic Cards
```elixir
<Cinder.Cards.cards resource={MyApp.User} actor={@current_user}>
  <:prop field="name" filter sort />
  <:prop field="email" filter />
  <:card :let={user}>
    <div class="user-card">
      <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">{user.name}</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600">{user.email}</p>
    </div>
  </:card>
</Cinder.Cards.cards>
```

### Advanced with Sorting & Themes
```elixir
<Cinder.Cards.cards 
  resource={MyApp.Product} 
  actor={@current_user}
  theme="modern"
  page_size={12}
  url_state={@url_state}
>
  <:prop field="name" filter sort />
  <:prop field="price" sort />
  <:prop field="category" filter={:select} />
  <:card :let={product}>
    <div class="product-card">
      <h3>{product.name}</h3>
      <p class="price">${product.price}</p>
      <span class="category">{product.category}</span>
    </div>
  </:card>
</Cinder.Cards.cards>
```

### Interactive Cards with Click Handling
```elixir
<Cinder.Cards.cards 
  resource={MyApp.Article}
  actor={@current_user}
  card_click={fn article -> JS.navigate(~p"/articles/#{article.id}") end}
>
  <:prop field="title" filter sort />
  <:prop field="author.name" filter />
  <:card :let={article}>
    <article class="article-card hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow">
      <h2>{article.title}</h2>
      <p>By {article.author.name}</p>
    </article>
  </:card>
</Cinder.Cards.cards>
```

## 🔄 Breaking Changes

**None** - This is a purely additive feature that doesn't modify any existing functionality.

## 🎉 When to Use Cards vs Tables

**Use Cards when:**
- Displaying rich content (images, multiple text fields)
- Content varies significantly in length  
- Visual appeal is important
- Mobile-first design is priority
- Creative layouts are desired

**Use Tables when:**
- Comparing data across rows
- Displaying structured, uniform data
- Dense information display is needed
- Traditional business applications

## 🚦 Commit History

This PR includes 22 well-organized commits that tell the development story:
- Theme system setup and base components
- Sort control implementation and UI
- Theme styling across all 8 built-in themes  
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Test coverage and integration fixes
- Code formatting and final polish

## ✨ Implementation Highlights

1. **Perfect API Consistency** - Uses the same patterns as Table component with appropriate adaptations for cards
2. **Comprehensive Theme Support** - All 8 themes include card-specific styling with sort controls
3. **Robust Error Handling** - Async loading with proper error states and logging
4. **Excellent Test Coverage** - Both unit and integration tests ensure reliability
5. **Production Ready** - Full feature parity with tables including URL sync and state management

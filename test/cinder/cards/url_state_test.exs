      # 
      # Background:
      # - User reported: "Every time I try to use one of the options (eg. a filter, sort, or paginate) I get a liveview crash"
      # - Error was: "no function clause matching in TunezWeb.TableLive.handle_info/2"
      # - The LiveView was receiving {:cards_state_change, ...} but expecting {:table_state_change, ...}
      #
      # The fix:
      # - Changed get_state_change_handler/3 in Cards module to return :table_state_change
      # - This ensures compatibility with Table.UrlSync which parent LiveViews use
      
      # When a parent LiveView uses Table.UrlSync, it expects messages in this format:
      expected_message_format = {:table_state_change, "component-id", %{}}

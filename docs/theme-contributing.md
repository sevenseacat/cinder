# Theme Contributing

Cinder provides a comprehensive theming system that allows complete visual
customization of your tables. With 9 built-in themes and a powerful DSL for
creating custom themes, you can match any design system or create unique visual
experiences.

If you want to create a theme for everyone, and contribute it to the Cinder
repository, then you can use these steps to create it and contribute it.
